    "The box plot is common in data analysis for investigating individual numerical variables. In this project, you will investigate and explain box plots and their uses. The boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create box plots. Your submission should be in the form of a repository containing a Jupyter notebook in which you detail your findings. In your notebook, you should:\n",
